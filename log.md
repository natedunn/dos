## Tuesday

- Nuxt.js seems like the obvious choice here. Loved messing around with it before, and this will be the stack of the company.
- Also remembering that Vuex is built in to Nuxt. For small apps and demos like this, its overkill. But for the sake of showing versatility in working with stores, I might just include it in the project. Setting up a basic store now.
- Drafting basic layout/design in code. Thought about doing everything in Figma first, but decided against it on account of time. I feel fine designing in the browser for this demo specifically. Now starting in a single-file and breaking things out as needed.
